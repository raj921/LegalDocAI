SAMPLE RENTAL AGREEMENT
(Basic / Beginning)
THIS AGREEMENT made this 15th Day of June, 2012, by and between ABC Properties, herein called
“Landlord,” and Silvia Mando, herein called “Tenant.” Landlord hereby agrees to rent to Tenant the dwelling
located at 9876 Cherry Avenue, Apartment 426 under the following terms and conditions.
1. FIXED-TERM AGREEMENT (LEASE):
Tenants agree to lease this dwelling for a fixed term of one year, beginning July 1, 2012 and
ending June 30, 2013. Upon expiration, this Agreement shall become a month-to-month agreement
AUTOMATICALLY, UNLESS either Tenants or Owners notify the other party in writing at least 30 days
prior to expiration that they do not wish this Agreement to continue on any basis.
2. RENT:
Tenant agrees to pay Landlord as base rent the sum of $685 per month, due and payable monthly in
advance on the 1st day of each month during the term of this agreement. The first month’s rent is required
to be submitted on or before move-in.
3. FORM OF PAYMENT:
Tenants agree to pay their rent in the form of a personal check, a cashier’s check, or a money order made
out to the Landlord.
4. RENT PAYMENT PROCEDURE:
Tenants agree to pay their rent by mail addressed to the Landlord at 426 Main Street, Anycity, USA, or in
person at the same address, or in such other way as the Landlord will advise the Tenant in writing.
5. RENT DUE DATE:
Tenant hereby acknowledges that late payment will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this
Rental Agreement. We allow for a 3 day grace period. In the event rent is not received prior to the 4th of
the month, Tenant agrees to pay a $25 late fee, plus an additional $5 per day for every day thereafter until
the rent is paid. Neither ill health, loss of job, financial emergency, or other excuses will be accepted for
late payment.
6. BAD-CHECK SERVICING CHARGE:
In the event Tenant’s check is dishonored and returned unpaid for any reason to Landlord, Tenant agrees
to pay a returned check charge of $25 AND accept whatever consequences there might be in making a
late payment. If for any reason a check is returned or dishonored, all future rent payments will be cash or
money order.
7. SECURITY DEPOSIT:
Tenants hereby agree to pay a security deposit of $685 to be refunded upon vacating, returning the keys to
the Landlord and termination of this contract according to other terms herein agreed. This deposit will be
held to cover any possible damage to the property. No interest will be paid on this money and in no case
will it be applied to back or future rent. It will be held intact by Landlord until at least thirty (30) working
days after Tenants have vacated the property. At that time Landlord will inspect the premises thoroughly
and assess any damages and/or needed repairs. This deposit money minus any necessary charges for
missing/dead light bulbs, repairs, cleaning, etc., will then be returned to Tenant with a written explanation
of deductions, within 60 days after they have vacated the property.

Pets are allowed on the premises only by obtaining the Landlords’ written permission first. When
possession of the property is given to the Tenant, only those pets listed on the Rental Application will be
allowed unless subsequent written permission has been granted. “Pets” does not include animals trained
to serve the handicapped, such as seeing-eye dogs, hearing dogs, or service dogs. These animals may be
housed on the premises so long as they are in the direct service of those they were trained to serve and
so long as Landlord is notified in advance in writing of the circumstances. In any case, when permission
is granted, owners are required to pay an additional $25 per month pet-rent charge for one or more.
Additionally, a pet-application sheet must be submitted before move-in.
If problems with pets occur there are several ways it may be handled depending on the events. If the pet is
in any way dangerous it will not be allowed on the premises. In the event of the owner being negligent in
regards to clean-up or allowing access to areas that the pet could damage the tenant will be fined or money
will be taken from the deposit. If the pet is a nuisance in any way the landlord may make suggestions to
how the pet is cared for or may require the tenant to attend a training course to be approved by the landlord.
Pets are never to be allowed in the yard unsupervised. Cleaning up after the pet is necessary immediately
following defecation. Constant barking will not be permitted.
